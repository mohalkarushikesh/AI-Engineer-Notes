Linear algebra 2 : matrix application

seesion : use tensors  in python and solve the system of equations and indentity meaninful patterns in data 

1. review introductory linear algebra
  1. what is linear algebra: solving for unknowns within of linear equations
  2. Modern Linear algebra applications
    a. solving for unknowns in ml algo, including deep learning
    b. Reducing dimentionality (e.g principal component analysis)
    c. Ranking results (e.g with eigen vector, including in google page Rank algorithm, see saaty and hu 1998)
    d. Recommenders (e.g singular value decomposition (SVD))
    e. Natural language processing (SVD, matrix factorization)
      1. Topic modeling
      2. semantic analysis
4. Eigen decomposition
5. matrix operations for machine learning
6.
