### The Frobenius Norm
- **Definition**: Measures the size of a matrix in terms of Euclidean distance.  
  It is the sum of the magnitudes of all the vectors in X.

### Special Matrices

**1. Symmetric Matrices**:
- **Properties**:
  - Must be a square matrix.
  - Transpose of the matrix equals the matrix itself: X^T = X 

**2. Identity Matrices**:
- **Definition**: A matrix where:
  - Every element along the main diagonal is 1
  - All other elements are 0

**3. Matrix Inversion**:
- **Definition**: The inverse of a matrix is another matrix such that their product equals the identity matrix.
  - Notation: X-1
  - **Condition**: The matrix must not be singular (i.e., all columns of the matrix must be linearly independent).

**4. Diagonal Matrices**:
- **Definition**: Only non-zero elements are along the main diagonal; all other elements are zero.  
  Example: Identity matrix.

**5. Orthogonal Matrices**: Dot-product of any two columms is zero 

### Properties of Orthogonal Matrices
- The inverse of an orthogonal matrix equals its transpose: ùê¥-1=ùê¥ùëá
- The product of a matrix and its transpose is an identity matrix:  AA^T = A^T A = I
- Determinant: {det}(A) = +-1
