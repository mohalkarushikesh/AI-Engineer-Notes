The Frobenius Norm
  Measures the size of the matrix in terms of ecludean distance
    it's the sum of the magnitude of all the vectors in X

Symmetric Matrices : special matrix case with following properties 
    square 
    XT=X
Identity Matrices: every element along main diagonal is 1
  all other elements are 0 
  
Matrix Inversion: The inverse of a matrix is another matrix, which by multiplying with the given matrix gives the identity matrix
denoted as X-1
only applied if the matirx isn't singular 
that is all columns of matrix must be linearly independent

Digonal Matrices: Non-Zero elements along with diagonal, zeros elsewhere else ex: indentity matrix 
  Properties of Orthogonal Matrix
  i.e., A-1 = AT. The product of A and its transpose is an identity matrix. i.e., AAT = ATA = I.   
  Determinant is det(A) = Â±1.
