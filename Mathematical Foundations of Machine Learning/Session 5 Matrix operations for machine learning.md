43. **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**
  - Unlike eigendecomposition, which is applicable to square matrices only, SVD is applicable to any real-value matrix
  - Decomposes matrix into:
    1. **Singular Vectors** (analogous to eigenvectors)
    2. **Singular Values** (analogous to eigenvalues)
  - For some matrix A, it's SVD is **A = UDV**T
  - Where:
  - U is an orthogonal m * m matrix; its columns are the left-singular vectors of A
  - V is an orthogonal n * n matrix; its columns are the right-singular vectors of A
  - D is a diagonal m * n matrix; elements along its diagonal are the singular values of A
