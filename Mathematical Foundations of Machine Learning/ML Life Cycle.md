Problem Formulation – Clearly define the problem and determine if it's a classification or regression task.

Data Acquisition – Obtain datasets from public sources (e.g. Kaggle, UCI) or collect your own data.

Data Cleaning & Labelling – Remove unnecessary features, clean noisy data, and label the dataset if needed.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Extract patterns and visualize the data to understand relationships.

Data Pre-processing – Handle missing values, outliers, correlations, and class imbalance; scale & encode features.

Dataset Splitting – Divide data into training, validation, and testing sets based on dataset size.

Model Training & Performance Evaluation – Train models, evaluate with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score (classification) or MSE, RMSE, MAE (regression).

Hyperparameter Tuning – Optimize models using techniques like GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV, or Optuna.

Final Evaluation – Validate the best model using the test set to measure real-world performance.

Model Deployment – Deploy your model via a web or mobile application using tools like Flask, APIs, Android Studio, or Flutter.
