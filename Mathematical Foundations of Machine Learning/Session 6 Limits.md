**Differentials**: optimize by finding minima and maxima of curves 
  - uses in engg (max strength ) and finance (min cost)
  - widely used in ML and DL
  - gradient descent to minimize the cost
  - gradient descent to maximize reward
  - Higher order derivates used in fancy optimizers (optimization)
