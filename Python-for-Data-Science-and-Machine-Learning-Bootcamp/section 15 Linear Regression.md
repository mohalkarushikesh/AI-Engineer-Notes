#### **🔹 Linear Regression**
Linear Regression is a **fundamental statistical and machine learning method** used to model relationships between variables. It predicts a **continuous dependent variable** based on one or more independent variables, assuming a **linear relationship**.

## **🔸 Historical Context**
- The term **"Regression"** was coined by **Sir Francis Galton** in the 19th century.
- He observed that the heights of sons tended to **regress towards** the population's average height instead of mirroring their fathers' extreme heights.  
- This concept inspired the name **"Regression"**, which describes the tendency of dependent variables to settle around a central trend.

## **🔸 Core Concept: Linear Relationship**
Linear Regression models the relationship between **dependent variable (Y)** and **independent variable(s) (X)** using a straight-line approach.

### **📌 Equation of Linear Regression**
\[
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \epsilon
\]
Where:
- **\(Y\)** → Dependent variable
- **\(X\)** → Independent variable
- **\(\beta_0\)** → Intercept (value of Y when X = 0)
- **\(\beta_1\)** → Slope (rate of change in Y per unit change in X)
- **\(\epsilon\)** → Error term (accounts for randomness in data)

### **📌 Key Methodology**
- The **Least Squares Method** is used to **find the best-fit line** by **minimizing the sum of squared residuals**.
- **Residual (error) = Actual value - Predicted value**
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
\]

## **🔸 Types of Linear Regression**
Linear Regression comes in multiple variations, each suited for different problems.

### **1️⃣ Simple Linear Regression (SLR)**
- **Uses**: Models the relationship between **one independent variable (X)** and **one dependent variable (Y)**.
- **Equation**:
\[
Y = \theta_0 + \theta_1 X + \epsilon
\]
- **Example**: Predicting **salary** based on **years of experience**.

### **2️⃣ Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)**
- **Uses**: Models relationships between **multiple independent variables** and **one dependent variable**.
- **Equation**:
\[
Y = \theta_0 + \theta_1 X_1 + \theta_2 X_2 + ... + \theta_n X_n + \epsilon
\]
- **Example**: Predicting **house prices** based on factors like **square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and amenities**.

### **3️⃣ Polynomial Regression**
- **Uses**: Captures **non-linear relationships** by introducing polynomial terms.
- **Equation**:
\[
Y = \theta_0 + \theta_1 X + \theta_2 X^2 + \theta_3 X^3 + ... + \theta_n X^n + \epsilon
\]
- **Example**: Predicting **growth rate** of bacteria over time when the trend isn’t linear.

### **4️⃣ Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)**
- **Uses**: Handles **multicollinearity** (high correlation among independent variables) by **penalizing large coefficients**.
- **Equation**:
\[
\min \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - y_i^*)^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{p} \theta_j^2
\]
- **Example**: Predicting **stock prices** with multiple correlated financial indicators.

### **5️⃣ Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)**
- **Uses**: Shrinks some coefficients to **zero**, effectively **selecting the most important features**.
- **Equation**:
\[
\min \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - y_i^*)^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{p} |\theta_j|
\]
- **Example**: Selecting **key factors** affecting **customer satisfaction**.

### **6️⃣ Elastic Net Regression**
- **Uses**: Combines **Ridge (L2) & Lasso (L1)** to balance feature selection and coefficient shrinkage.
- **Equation**:
\[
\min \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - y_i^*)^2 + \lambda_1 \sum_{j=1}^{p} |\theta_j| + \lambda_2 \sum_{j=1}^{p} \theta_j^2
\]
- **Example**: Predicting **sales revenue** using numerous interrelated factors.

### **7️⃣ Stepwise Regression**
- **Uses**: **Automates feature selection** by systematically adding/removing predictors based on statistical significance.
- **Example**: **Medical diagnosis models**, where only the most relevant patient data is used.

### **8️⃣ Quantile Regression**
- **Uses**: Instead of predicting **mean values**, it estimates **percentiles** of the dependent variable distribution.
- **Example**: **Predicting house prices in different market segments**.

### **9️⃣ Bayesian Regression**
- **Uses**: Estimates parameters using **probability distributions**, useful in **small datasets or uncertain predictions**.
- **Example**: **Weather forecasting with incomplete data**.

## **🔸 Assumptions of Linear Regression**
✔ **Linear Relationship** → The independent and dependent variables must have a linear correlation.  
✔ **Normal Distribution of Residuals** → Residuals should follow a normal distribution.  
✔ **Homoscedasticity** → Residuals should have **constant variance** at all levels of independent variables.  
✔ **Minimal Multicollinearity** → Independent variables should not be highly correlated in **multiple regression**.

## **🔸 Evaluation Metrics**
To measure the accuracy of a Linear Regression model, common metrics include:

### **📌 Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
\[
MAE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \hat{y}_i|
\]
- Measures the **average absolute difference** between actual and predicted values.
- **Lower MAE** indicates a better model.

### **📌 Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
\[
MSE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
\]
- **Penalizes larger errors**, making it sensitive to outliers.

### **📌 Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
\[
RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}
\]
- Expressed in the same units as the dependent variable.
