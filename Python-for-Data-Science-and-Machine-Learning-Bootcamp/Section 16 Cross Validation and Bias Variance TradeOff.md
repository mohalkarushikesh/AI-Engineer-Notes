# Bias-Variance Trade-Off

## Definition
The **Bias-Variance Trade-Off** is the point where model complexity starts introducing noise into predictions. As the model becomes more flexible, the training error decreases, but the test error begins to rise, indicating overfitting.

## Key Concepts
1. **Training Error Behavior**:
   - Training error consistently reduces with increased model complexity (flexibility).

2. **Test Error Behavior**:
   - After reaching the bias-variance trade-off point, the test error begins to increase due to overfitting.

3. **Optimal Model**:
   - Aim for a model with **low bias** and **low variance** to achieve the best balance between accuracy and generalization.
