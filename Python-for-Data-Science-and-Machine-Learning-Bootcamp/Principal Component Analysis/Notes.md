- Principal Component Analysis is statistical technique used examine the interelations among the set of variables
inorder to identify the underlying structure of those variables
- also known as general factor analysis
- where regression determines a line of best fit to a dataset, factor analysis determines several orthogonal lines of best fit dataset
- Orthogonal means 'At right angles'
  - Actually lines are perpandicular to each other in n-dimentional space 
- n-Dimentional Spaces is the variable sample space 
  - There are as many dimentions as there are variables, so the dataset with 4 variables the sample space is 4 dimentional

- Components are linear transformation that chooses the variable system for dataset such that the greatest variance of the dataset
  comes to lie on the first axis 
- the second greatest variance on second axis and so on..
- This process allows us to reduce no of variables used in an analysis

- Note that components are uncorrelated, since in the sample space they are othogonal to each other 
- we can continue this analysis in hiher dimentions

- if we continue this technique on a dataset with the large no of variables, we can compress the amount of explained variation to just a few components 
- The most challenging part of the PCA is interpreting the components
