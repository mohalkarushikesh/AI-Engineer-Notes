**Recommender System**
- The most common types of recommender systems are Content-Based and Collaborative filtering (CF)
- Content Based : recommender systems focus on the attributes of the items and give you recommendations based on similarity between them
- Collaborative Filtering: produces recommedations based on the knowlege of user's attitude to items that it is uses the 'wisdom of the crowd' to recommend items.
- In general CF is more commonly used than CB systems because it usually gives better resuls and is relatively easy to understand (from overall implementation perspective)
- The algorithm has ability to do feature learning on its own which means that it can start to learn for itself what features to use
